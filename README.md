Harness the power of AWS Bedrock AI to convert natural language to visual charts
using [chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/api/).

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or later)
- npm (version 6 or later) or Yarn (version 1.22 or later)
- AWS Bedrock

### Installation

**1\. Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LibertySource/ai-chart
```

**2\. Navigate to the project directory**

```bash
cd ai-chart
```

**3\. Install dependencies:**

Using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

Or using Yarn:

```bash
yarn install
```

**4\. Configure AWS Bedrock**

With AWS Bedrock Builder tools, create a prompt and Flow similar to the
following

```text
You will be given a description of information that will be displayed as a graph using Chart.js.  Your job is to take the information provided and create the JSON object below that will generate the chart using Chart.js.

The response you send will programmatically be used in the following manner:

new Chart(ctx, {IMPORTANT: your task is to generate this JSON object})

Be sure to only return the JSON object that will be used in the Chart function previously mentioned.

Here is the input text {{input}}

IMPORTANT: do not provide any explantion and make sure the only response is a 100% valid JSON object.  Review the JSON and make sure there are no trailing commas that would invalidate the JSON.

ERROR CONDITIONS:

1) if no data is suplied then respond only with this JSON object: {"Error": "No data supplied"}

2) If you cannot generate the Chart.js JSON for any reason then respond only with this JSON object {"Error": "Update this text with description why chart could not be created"}
```

Copy src/.env to src/.env.local and update variables with Prompt Flow Ids from
above.

Using npm:

```bash
npm run dev
```
